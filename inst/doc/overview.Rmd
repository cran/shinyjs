# shinyjs

`shinyjs` lets you perform common useful JavaScript operations in Shiny 
applications without having to know any JavaScript. Examples include hiding an 
element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to its original value,
and many more useful functions. `shinyjs` can also be used to
easily run your own custom JavaScript functions from R.

You can [check out a demo Shiny app](http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-demo/) that lets
you play around with some of the functionality that `shinyjs` makes available,
or [have a look at a very basic Shiny app](http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-basic/)
that uses `shinyjs` to enhance the user experience with very minimal and 
simple R code.

## Installation

`shinyjs` is available through both CRAN and GitHub:

To install the CRAN version:

```
install.packages("shinyjs")
```

To install the latest developmental version from GitHub:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("daattali/shinyjs")
```

## Overview of main functions

- `show`/`hide`/`toggle` - display or hide an element. There are arguments
that control the animation as well, though animation is off by default.

- `hidden` - initialize a Shiny tag as invisible (can be shown later with a call
to `show`).

- `reset` - reset a Shiny input widget back to its original value.

- `enable`/`disable`/`toggleState` - enable or disable an input element, such
as a button or a text input.

- `info` - show a message to the user (using JavaScript's `alert` under the
hood).

- `text` - change the text/HTML of an element (using JavaScript's `innerHTML`
under the hood).

- `onclick` - run R code when an element is clicked. Was originally developed
with the sole purpose of running a `shinyjs` function when an element is
clicked, though any R code can be used.

- `addClass`/`removeClass`/`toggleClass` - add or remove a CSS class from
an element

- `inlineCSS` - easily add inline CSS to a Shiny app.

- `logjs` - print a message to the JavaScript console (mainly used for
debugging purposes).

- `runjs` - run arbitrary JavaScript code (not recommended to use this in a
published Shiny app).

- `extendShinyjs` - allows you to write your own JavaScript functions and use
`shinyjs` to call them as if they were regular R code. More information is
available in the section "Calling your own JavaScript functions from R".

[Check out the demo Shiny app](http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-demo/) to see
some of these in action, or install `shinyjs` and run `shinyjs::runExample()`
to see more demo apps.


## Motivation

Shiny is a fantastic R package provided by RStudio that lets you turn any R
code into an interactive webpage.  It's very powerful and one of the most
useful packages in my opinion. But there are just a few simple pieces of
functionality that I always find missing and I implement myself in my Shiny apps using
JavaScript (JS) because it's either not supported natively by Shiny or it's just
cleaner to do so. Simple things like showing/hiding elements, enabling/disabling
a button, showing a popup message to the user, manipulating the CSS class or
HTML content of an element, etc.

After noticing that I'm writing the same JS
code in all my apps, and since making Shiny talk to JS is a bit tedious
and annoying with all the message passing, I decided to just package it to make
it easily reusable.  Now I can simply call `hide("panel")` or `disable("button")`.
I was lucky enough to have previous experience with JS so I knew how to
achieve the results that I wanted, but for any Shiny developer who is not
proficient in JS, hopefully this package will make it easy to extend the power
of their Shiny apps.

## Basic use case - complete working example

*You can view the final Shiny app developed in this simple example
[here](http://daattali.com/shiny/shinyjs-basic/).*

Suppose we want to have a simple Shiny app that collects a user's basic
information (name, age, company) and submits it, along with the time of
submission.  Here is a very simple implementation of such an app (nothing
actually happens when the user "submits").

```
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    div(id = "myapp",
      h2("shinyjs demo"),
      textInput("name", "Name", ""),
      numericInput("age", "Age", 30),
      textInput("company", "Company", ""),
      p("Timestamp: ", span(date())),
      actionButton("submit", "Submit")
    )
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output) {
  }
)
```

*Note that I generally don't like running Shiny apps like this and prefer to
declare the UI and server separately, but I do it like this here for brevity.*

Here is what that app would look like

![Demo app](../inst/img/demo-basic-v1.png)

Now suppose we want to add a few features to the app to make it a bit more
user-friendly.  First we need to set up the app to use `shinyjs` with two
small changes

1. A call to `useShinyjs()` needs to be made in the Shiny app's UI. This is
required to set up all the JavaScript and a few other things.

2. The app's server needs to have the `session` parameter declared, ie.
initialize the server as `server(input, output, session)` instead of
`server(input, output)`.

Here are 7 features we'll add to the app, each followed with the code to
implement it using `shinyjs`:

**1. The "Name" field is mandatory and thus the "Submit" button should not be
enabled if there is no name**

In the server portion, add the following code

```
observe({
  if (is.null(input$name) || input$name == "") {
    shinyjs::disable("submit")
  } else {
    shinyjs::enable("submit")
  }
})
```

Or instead you can use the `toggleState` function and pass it a `condition`:

```
observe({
  shinyjs::toggleState("submit", !is.null(input$name) && input$name != "")
})
```

You can use the optional `condition` in some other functions as well, which
can be very useful to make your code shorter and more understandable.

**2. The "Age" and "Company" fields are optional and we want to have the ability
to hide that section of the form**

First, we need to section off the "Age" and "Company" elements into their own
section, so we surround them with a `div`

```
div(id = "advanced",
  numericInput("age", "Age", 30),
  textInput("company", "Company", "")
)
```

We also need to add a link in the UI that will be used to hide/show the section  

```
a(id = "toggleAdvanced", "Show/hide advanced info")
```

Lastly, we need to tell Shiny to show/hide the section when the link is clicked
by adding this code to the server

```
shinyjs::onclick("toggleAdvanced",
                  shinyjs::toggle(id = "advanced", anim = TRUE))
```

**3. Similarly, since we don't really care about "Age" and "Company" too much, we
want to hide them initially when the form loads**

Simply surround the section we want to hide initially with `shinyjs::hidden`

```
shinyjs::hidden(
  div(id = "advanced",
    ...
))
```

**4. The user should be able to update the "Timestamp" in case he spends way too
long filling out the form (not very realistic here, and the timestamp should
ideally be determined when the button is clicked, but it's good enough for
illustration purposes)**

First, we need to add an "Update" link to click on, and we need to give the
element showing the time an `id` so that we can refer to it later when we
want to change its contents.

To do that, replace `p("Timestamp: ", span(date()))` with  

```
p("Timestamp: ", span(id = "time", date()), a(id = "update", "Update"))
```

Now we need to tell Shiny what to do when "Update" is clicked by adding this
to the server

```
shinyjs::onclick("update", shinyjs::text("time", date()))
```

**5. Some users may find it hard to read the small text in the app, so there should
be an option to increase the font size**

First, we need to add checkbox to the UI

```
checkboxInput("big", "Bigger text", FALSE)
```

In order to make the text bigger, we will use CSS.  So let's add an appropriate
CSS rule by adding this code to the UI

```
shinyjs::inlineCSS(list(.big = "font-size: 2em"))
```

Lastly, we want the text to be big or small depending on whether the checkbox
is checked by adding this code to the server

```
observe({
  if (input$big) {
    shinyjs::addClass("myapp", "big")
  } else {
    shinyjs::removeClass("myapp", "big")
  }
})
```

Or, again, we can use the `toggleClass` function with the `condition` argument:

```
observe({
  shinyjs::toggleClass("myapp", "big", input$big)
})
```

**6. Give the user a "Thank you" message upon submission**

Simply add the following to the server

```
observeEvent(input$submit, {
  shinyjs::info("Thank you!")
})
```

**7. Allow the user to reset the form**

First let's add a button to the UI

```
actionButton("reset", "Reset form")
```

And when the button is clicked, reset the form

```
observeEvent(input$reset, {
  shinyjs::reset("myapp")
})
```

**The final code looks like this** (I'm using the more compact `toggle*` version
where possible)

```
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    shinyjs::useShinyjs(),
    shinyjs::inlineCSS(list(.big = "font-size: 2em")),
    div(id = "myapp",
        h2("shinyjs demo"),
        checkboxInput("big", "Bigger text", FALSE),
        textInput("name", "Name", ""),
        a(id = "toggleAdvanced", "Show/hide advanced info", href = "#"),
        shinyjs::hidden(
          div(id = "advanced",
            numericInput("age", "Age", 30),
            textInput("company", "Company", "")
          )
        ),
        p("Timestamp: ",
          span(id = "time", date()),
          a(id = "update", "Update", href = "#")
        ),
        actionButton("submit", "Submit"),
        actionButton("reset", "Reset form")
    )
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output, session) {
    observe({
      shinyjs::toggleState("submit", !is.null(input$name) && input$name != "")
    })
    
    shinyjs::onclick("toggleAdvanced",
                     shinyjs::toggle(id = "advanced", anim = TRUE))    
    
    shinyjs::onclick("update", shinyjs::text("time", date()))
    
    observe({
      shinyjs::toggleClass("myapp", "big", input$big)
    })
    
    observeEvent(input$submit, {
      shinyjs::info("Thank you!")
    })
    
    observeEvent(input$reset, {
      shinyjs::reset("myapp")
    })    
  }
)
```

## Calling your own JavaScript functions from R

You can also use `shinyjs` to simplify calling your own JavaScript functions
from R, using `extendShinyjs`.

For example, suppose you wanted to define a JavaScript function that will change
the colour of some text. You might know that Shiny allows you 
to send a message to the client using the `session$sendCustomMessage` interface.
That works perfectly well, but using `extendShinyjs` has two main benefits: it
makes you write a lot less code by taking care of all the message passing, and
it can help you with normalizing the parameter passing from R to JavaScript.

Using `extendShinyjs` in order to use your own functions as shinyjs functions
is easy. Any JavaScript function you define that begins with `shinyjs.` will
be available to run from R through the `js$` variable. For example, if you write
a JavaScript function called `shinyjs.colour`, then you can call it in R with
`js$colour()`.

### Basic example of `extendShinyjs` using inline JavaScript code

As an extremely basic example, here is a shiny app that adds a function called
`pageCol` that will simply change the background of the page to a certain colour.
It isn't very useful, but it shows how easy it can be to call custom
JavaScript code.

We need to make a call to `extendShinyjs(text = code)`, where `code` is JavaScript
code that defines a function named `shinyjs.pageCol` which changes the page colour.
Then we can call that function from the server using `js$pageCol()`.

```
library(shiny)
runApp(shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    useShinyjs(),
    extendShinyjs(text =
      "shinyjs.pageCol = function(params){$('body').css('background', params);}"),
    actionButton("btn", "Click me")
  ),
  server = function(input, output, session) {
    observeEvent(input$btn, {
      js$pageCol("red")
    })
  }
))
```

As you can see, the JavaScript function named `shinyjs.pageCol` gets called
from R with `js$pageCol()`. This is the way any custom JavaScript function
works with `extendShinyjs`.

### Basic example of `extendShinyjs` using a separate JavaScript file

The previous example used the `text` argument to give `extendShinyjs` the 
JavaScript code as a string. That generally works well for very short JS
functions, but when the code is more complex it's recommended to place it in a
separate file. Here are the steps to create a similar app, but this time we'll
place the JavaScript code in a separate file.

#### 1. Create a JavaScript file

Create a JavaScript file `www/js/shinyjs-ext.js` and define the same function
as before.

```
shinyjs.pageCol = function(params) {
  $('body').css('background', params);
}
```

#### 2. Create a shiny app

In order to use the new function we created, we need to call `extendShinyjs()`
in the UI with the script as an argument.

Any function defined inside the script file we provided in the UI will now be 
accessible in the server, so we can call `js$pageCol("red")`.

```
library(shiny)
runApp(shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    useShinyjs(),
    extendShinyjs("www/js/shinyjs-ext.js"),
    actionButton("btn", "Click me")
  ),
  server = function(input, output, session) {
    observeEvent(input$btn, {
      js$pageCol("red")
    })
  }
))
```

### More complex example of `extendShinyjs` with parameter passing

Let's go back to the example from the beginning of the section: adding a function
that will change the colour of an HTML element. This example will demonstrate
the useful feature that `shinyjs` provides in normalizing parameters.

In JavaScript, given the id of an element and a colour, we can use these two
simple lines of code to apply the colour to the HTML element:

```
var el = $("#" + id);
el.css('color', col);
```

To turn this into a `shinyjs` function, we need to put it inside a function 
that has one parameter and whose name starts with `shinyjs.`. When calling a
`shinyjs` function in R, the corresponding JavaScript function will be given a
single array-like parameter. If the function in R was called with unnamed
arguments (for example `function(1, "a")`) then the parameter will be an
`Array` object; if the arguments are named (for example `function(x = 1, y = "a")`)
then the parameter will be an `Object` with key-value pairs (each key is an
argument name and the value is the argument's value).

`shinyjs` provides a `shinyjs.getParams()` function to normalize JavaScript 
parameters, which serves two purposes. First of all, it ensures that all 
arguments are named (even if the R function was called without names). Secondly,
it also allows you to define default values for arguments. Here is an 
implementation of our JavaScript function to change the colour of an element,
with the default colour being red if not specified.

```
shinyjs.colour = function(params) {
  var defaultParams = {
    id : null,
    col : "red"
  };
  params = shinyjs.getParams(params, defaultParams);

  var el = $("#" + params.id);
  el.css('color', params.col);
}
```

All the default `shinyjs` functions use `shinyjs.getParams()`, and it is highly
recommended to always use it in a similar manner to what is shown here. 
Otherwise, you'll have to manually deal with the given parameter being either
an Array or an Object, and you will have to manually account for default parameter
values.

Any shiny app that includes a file with the above function will be able to call
`js$colour()` from the app's server. Here are a few ways to call the function:
`js$colour("id")`, `js$colour("id", "blue")`, `js$colour(col = "yellow", id = "id")`.
Note that the order of the arguments in `defaultParams` in the JavaScript function
matches the order of the arguments when calling the function in R with
unnamed arguments. For example, calling `js$colour("red", "id")` will not work
because the arguments are not named and the JavaScript function expects id to come
before colour. Also note that if we don't provide a colour, red will be used.

Here is a simple shiny app that uses the above function, assuming it's also
placed in `www/js/shinyjs-ext.js`:

```
library(shiny)
library(shinyjs)
runApp(shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    useShinyjs(),
    extendShinyjs("www/js/shinyjs-ext.js"),
    p(id = "text", "Paragraph 1"),
    selectInput("col", "Colour:", c("blue", "yellow", "red", "black")),
    actionButton("btn", "Change colour")
  ),
  server = function(input,output,session) {
    observeEvent(input$btn, {
      js$colour("text", input$col)
    })
  }
))
```

You can read more about this feature with `?shinyjs::extendShinyjs`.


## Altenatives using native Shiny

The initial release of this package was announced [on my blog](http://deanattali.com/2015/04/23/shinyjs-r-package/)
and discusses this topic.
