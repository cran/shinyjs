This gadget lets you choose colours easily. You can select multiple colours,
and you can either choose any RGB colour, or browse through R colours. \cr

the \code{colourpicker} package. Please use the \code{colourpicker} package
in the future.}

\note{
This gadget returns a vector of colours that can be assigned to a variable.
If instead you want to get a text representation of the colours that can
embedded into code, use the addin from the RStudio Addins menu.
